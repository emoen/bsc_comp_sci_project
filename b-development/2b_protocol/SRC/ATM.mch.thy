/*
Two macros are built-in for use as antecedents in rules of UserLibX:

     Trace__(x)    causes the formula `x' to be printed out
                    when the rule is applied

  Constant__(x)    prohibits the rule from being applied
                    when `x' is not a constant

More may be added to DEFINITIONS below.

Other theory files may be included through the INCLUSIONS clause
